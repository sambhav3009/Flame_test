# Flame Test Simulator ðŸ”¥

Welcome to the **Flame Test Simulator**, a simple Python program to simulate flame test experiments! This project allows users to identify elements based on their flame colors and learn additional information about the chemical process behind each test.

## Features âœ¨

- Simulates flame test colors for common elements.
- Supports input by element names or chemical symbols.
- Provides additional information about the flame test process for each element.
- Handles both case sensitivity and whitespace in user input.

## Elements Supported ðŸŒˆ

The following elements are currently supported:
- Lithium (Li) â€“ Brick Red
- Sodium (Na) â€“ Yellow
- Potassium (K) â€“ Lilac
- Copper (Cu) â€“ Blue/Green
- Calcium (Ca) â€“ Orange

## How It Works ðŸ§ª

1. The user inputs the name or chemical symbol of an element.
2. The simulator displays the flame color associated with that element.
3. Users can choose to learn more about the elementâ€™s flame test process.
